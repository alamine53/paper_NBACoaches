\section{Data}

The NBA consists of 30 teams that compete over 82 games. The number of wins at the end of each season determines their ranking. \footnote{The post-season extends until June but this study is limited to the regular season} Using data between 1978 and 2017, I construct a coach-team matched panel dataset and trace the performance of head coaches as they move around the league. I use performance-based metrics to control for player talent and count the number of games missed as a proxy for injuries.

Coaching changes are more frequent in the NBA than in other sports leagues. On average, teams replace their head coach every X years and each head coach averages 2.1 teams over the course of his career. Most coaching changes occur prior to the start of a season but some may take place mid-season. For the sake of this analysis, only full-season are considered in the analysis. In other words, all mid-season hires are considered to take place in the following off-season. 

The total number of NBA head coaches covered in this study is 164. This includes all of those who appeared between the 1977-78 and the 2016-17 season. To be considered for analysis, coaches are required to spend at least one full season on a given team. This condition leaves out those hired on interim basis because they are unlikely to leave a footprint. Out of the initial sample of 164 head coaches, 154 remain after after this condition is applied. Table 1 provides summary statistics for all the coaches in the sample. Around 60 percent of coaches are observed on more than one team, a much higher ratio than in other sports leagues. \footnote{For example, the German BundesLiga (professional soccer) only has a 30 percent mover ratio.} The average length of a head coach's career spans 7.2 seasons and typically covers 2.1 tenures \footnote{One tenure represents an interrupted team-coach relationship}. These figures are subject to high standard deviations as some coaches spend as little as one season while others, such as Don Nelson, have spent as long as 31 seasons.
